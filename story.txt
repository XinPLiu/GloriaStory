I am a cool boy, now it is 4 am, staying up late is a very cool thing. I have an exam at 7:45 in the morning. I think I can sit on the sofa and wait for the sunrise.

I am a dope kid, instead of studying I watch Netflix all night. The sun rises but I still haven't studied for my test (oops). I'm walking out the door frantically looking through my lecture notes.
