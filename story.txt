I am a cool boy, now it is 4 am, staying up late is a very cool thing. I have an exam at 7:45 in the morning. I think I can sit on the sofa and wait for the sunrise.

I am a dope kid, instead of studying I watch Netflix all night. The sun rises but I still haven't studied for my test (oops). I'm walking out the door frantically looking through my lecture notes.

I'm walking to the class, cars passing by, me saying "I'm walking here," and then a truck passes by and splashes me with a big puddle. Now all my papers are wet, and I'm not ready for my exam, with my last hope having been soaked.
I'm a upset kid, failling all my exams afterall, I don't know how to tell my mom
